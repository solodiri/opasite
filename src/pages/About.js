            famous King Jaja in Rivers State, Nigeria; OPUBO PROGRESSIVE
            ASSOCIATION is a Non-Governmental Organization established to
            galvanize the people of Ibani leaving within Ndoki and its Environs.
            Conceived in 2010 by two great minds, Late Mr. Gbarachua Epelle and
            Mr. Ibisonye Kala-Ogolo, the idea was inspired by Sen S. J Tolofari,
            who became the pioneer Chairman of the Association. The main purpose
            of OPA is to harnize the human and material potiantial of it's
            people and showcase Opobo and her rich cultural heritage to the
            world.

            In the years to come, OPUBO PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION hopes to become
            the voice of the people. The Association is headed by a team of
            young people who thought it wise to use this platform as an avenue
            to showcase the rich cultural heritage, while attracting people from
            all over the world to Opobo.
