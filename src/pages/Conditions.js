          <h2>The Hostory of King Jaja Of Opobo</h2>
          <p>
            King Jaja of Opobo (full name: Jubo Jubogha; 1821â€“1891) was the
            first king (amanyanabo) of Opobo. He was also the founder of Opobo
            Kingdom in present-day Rivers State and Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria.
          </p>

          <p>
            In his youth, Jaja was kidnapped from Igboland by black slave
            raiders and sold into slavery. He was then brought to Ijawland
            thereafter. As was customary amongst the Ijaw, Jaja earned his way
            out of slavery after serving his master for a number of years. At
            the death of his master, he took charge of the trade and went on to
            head the Anna Pepple House merchant faction of Bonny. Under him,
            Annie Pepple absorbed other trade houses until a war with the
            Manilla Pepple House led by Oko Jumbo compelled Jaja to break away
            to establish Opobo Kingdom (26 miles east of Bonny) in 1869.
          </p>

          <p>
            Opobo came to be a prominent trading post in the region's palm oil
            trade. Jaja barred entry to European and African middlemen,
            effectively monopolizing trade, and by 1870 was selling eight
            thousand tons of palm oil directly to the British. Opobo also
            shipped palm oil directly to Liverpool. Despite his trade rivalry
            with the Europeans, Jaja sent his children to schools in Glasgow and
            enlisted whites to staff the secular school he built in Opobo. He
            barred any missionaries from entering Opobo.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the 1884 Berlin Conference the Europeans designated Opobo as
            British territory. When Jaja refused to cease taxing the British
            traders, Henry Hamilton Johnston, a British vice consul, invited
            Jaja for negotiations in 1887. Jaja was arrested on arrival aboard a
            British vessel; he was tried in Accra in the Gold Coast (now Ghana)
            then exiled, first to London, and later to Saint Vincent and
            Barbados in the British West Indies. His presence in the West Indies
            was alleged to be the cause of civil unrest, as the people of
            Barbados, of African descent, were upset at the poor treatment of a
            King from their homeland.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1891, Jaja was granted permission to return to Opobo, but died en
            route. Following his exile and death, the power of the Opobo state
            rapidly declined. In 1903 the King Jaja of Opobo Memorial was
            erected in his honor in Opobo town centre.
          </p>

          <p>
            The grave of Nigerian Prince Waribo, son of King Jaja of Opobo is in
            the churchyard at St Laurence Parish Church, Frodsham, Cheshire.
            Prince Waribo was sent to Frodsham to be educated at Manor House
            School. He sadly died from inflammation of the lungs on 21st April
            1882. There are 2 white arrows indicating the way to the Prince's
            grave. One at the entrance opposite the Ring O,'Bells and the other
            further down the pathway showing the direction to his grave. It has
            no headstone but there is an inscription on the edging stone.
